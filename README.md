# Paragraphiser Bot

This bot crawls some subs on reddit, and looks for self posts that are really long walls of text without line breaks.
This bot then comments on those posts, suggesting that OP break it up into many smaller paragraphs.

It's daunting to see long unbroken walls of text. 
I hope that by writing this bot, I will help people write better posts, which makes the reddit community better for everyone.

If you want to write your own bot, have a look at [my template](https://github.com/mlda065/paragraphiser_bot_aws).
